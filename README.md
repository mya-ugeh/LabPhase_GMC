# Predicting Chronic Disease with Patient Health Data

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting chronic diseases using patient health data. Chronic diseases are a significant global health concern, and early prediction can lead to timely interventions and improved patient outcomes. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and make predictions regarding the likelihood of chronic diseases.

2.  Navigate to the project directory

3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to perform data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering,
and model building.



## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains patient health data and information about the presence or absence of
chronic diseases. Detailed information about the dataset can be found in the data directory.




## Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

In the EDA phase, we analyze the dataset to understand its structure, visualize data distributions, and explore 
relationships between variables. This helps us identify important features for prediction.



## Data Processing

Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling/normalizing
numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.



## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is performed to create relevant and informative features that can improve the predictive 
power of the models.



## Model Building

We build machine learning models to predict the presence or absence of chronic diseases based on patient health 
data. Multiple algorithms are evaluated, and the best-performing model is selected.



## Evaluation

We assess model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and 
F1-score. Model results and insights are discussed in the notebooks.



## Conclusion

In the conclusion section, we summarize the project's findings, discuss limitations, and provide recommendations 
for further research and application of chronic disease prediction.
